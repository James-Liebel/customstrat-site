Prioritize moments that matter (e.g., vehicle crashes, claims payments, coverage clarity) and invest in a human-digital interface that demonstrates much-needed empathy with customers. Another approach in these times is to provide more customer benefits - regular policy reviews to highlight saving/coverage opportunities, advice on higher deductibles, missed bundling discounts, and other ways to help save money and time for customers. It’s an opportune time to promote usage-based and behavior-based insurance products, showcasing the savings benefits of lower vehicle usage, safer driving, etc. Lastly, granular price adjustments (e.g., less on long tenure and higher on early monoline) will demonstrate the value of tenure and loyalty."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"With marketing budgets under pressure, find growth through deepening existing relationships.

Even small actions like jointly eliminating waste in the system with third-party claims vendors deliver significant savings due to the large cost base / installed vehicles/homes in force.
